## 🔍 Overview
The Banking Application leverages a microservices architecture, utilizing the Spring Boot framework alongside other Spring projects such as Spring Data JPA, Spring Cloud, and Spring Security. Maven is used for dependency management. This setup includes critical components like Service Registry, API Gateway, and more.

These technologies enable the development of independent microservices: a user service for managing users, an account service for handling account operations, a fund transfer service for managing transfers, and a transaction service for transaction management. This architecture ensures scalability, maintainability, and robustness in our banking system.

## 🏛️ Architecture
- **Service Registry**: Utilizes a discovery service for registering and discovering microservices. This allows microservices to communicate without hardcoded endpoints.
- **API Gateway**: Centralizes API endpoints, providing a common entry point for all requests. It also handles security, including authentication and authorization.
- **Database per Microservice**: Each microservice has its own dedicated database, isolating services and allowing independent scaling. This application uses MySQL for all microservices, facilitating schema independence and scalability.

## 🚀 Microservices
- **👤 User Service**: Manages user operations including registration, updating details, viewing user information, and managing user accounts. It also handles authentication and authorization.
- **💼 Account Service**: Manages account operations such as modifying details, viewing accounts, accessing transaction histories, and closing accounts.
- **💸 Fund Transfer Service**: Facilitates fund transfers between accounts, providing detailed transfer records and transaction details.
- **💳 Transactions Service**: Manages transactions, allowing users to view transactions by account or reference ID, and perform deposits or withdrawals.

## 🚀 Getting Started
To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Ensure Java 17 is installed. Download it from the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk17-downloads.html).
2. Choose an IDE like Eclipse, Spring Tool Suite, or IntelliJ IDEA and set it up according to your preferences.
3. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/bank_app.git
    cd bank_app
    ```
4. Configure the database in `src/main/resources/application.properties`:
    ```properties
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/banking_db
    spring.datasource.username=your_username
    spring.datasource.password=your_password

    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
    spring.jpa.show-sql=true
    spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect
    ```
5. Build and run the application:
    ```sh
    ./gradlew bootRun
    ```
6. Configure Keycloak for authentication and authorization. Refer to the [Keycloak configuration guide](#) for detailed instructions.
7. Ensure all dependent microservices and APIs are up and running to avoid workflow issues.

## 📖 Documentation
### 📖 API Documentation
For detailed API endpoints and usage instructions, refer to our [API Documentation](#). This resource provides a comprehensive overview of the banking application’s API.

### 📚 Java Documentation (JavaDocs)
Explore our [Java Documentation](#) for in-depth information on classes, methods, and variables across all microservices. This resource aids developers in understanding the codebase for seamless development and maintenance.

## ⌚ Future Enhancements
We are planning several improvements to enhance the banking application:
- **Notification System**: Implementing email and SMS notifications to inform users about important account activities.
- **Deposit and Investment Features**: Adding functionalities for managing savings and investments, such as fixed deposits and portfolio tracking.
