## 🔍 About
The Banking Application is a robust system built using the Spring Boot framework. It leverages Spring Data JPA for database interactions, Spring Security for authentication and authorization, and PostgreSQL as the database. The application provides essential banking functionalities such as account management, fund transfers, deposits, and withdrawals.

## 🏛️ Architecture
- **Spring Boot:** The core framework used to build the application.
- **Spring Data JPA:** Manages data persistence and interactions with the PostgreSQL database.
- **Spring Security:** Ensures secure authentication and authorization processes.
- **PostgreSQL:** The relational database used to store application data.

## 🚀 Services
The Banking Application consists of several microservices, each handling specific functionalities:
- **User Service:** Manages user registration, authentication, and profile management.
- **Account Service:** Handles account operations including creation, management, and transaction histories.
- **Fund Transfer Service:** Facilitates fund transfer operations between accounts.
- **Transaction Service:** Records and manages transaction histories for auditing and reporting purposes.

## 🚀 Getting Started
To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Ensure Java 17 is installed. Download it from the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk17-downloads.html).
2. Choose an IDE like Eclipse, Spring Tool Suite, or IntelliJ IDEA and set it up according to your preferences.
3. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/bank_app.git
    cd bank_app
    ```
4. Configure the database in `src/main/resources/application.properties`:
    ```properties
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/banking_db
    spring.datasource.username=your_username
    spring.datasource.password=your_password

    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
    spring.jpa.show-sql=true
    spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect
    ```
5. Build and run the application:
    ```sh
    ./gradlew bootRun
    ```
